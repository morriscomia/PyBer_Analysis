# Overview of the analysis:
  The goal of this challenge is to provide ridesharing data visualizations for PyBer in order to promote access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underprivileged neighborhoods.

  The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an overview comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban cities. The summary demonstrates that there is a larger demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities. The figure below highlights how rides in Urban cities contributed the most to PyBer's overall rides during this five-month period.

In terms of costs, it appears that riders in rural cities pay on average almost $10 more for PyBer than riders in urban cities. The average fare per ride is about $35 in rural cities whereas the average fare per ride is about $25 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per ride falls just in between - at about $31. While it may not be good news for riders in rural cities, it is a better market for drivers in this type of city. The average fare per driver is about $55 in rural cities, whereas the average fare per driver is about $17 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per driver is about $40.

# Summary:

There is a larger use of PyBer ridesharing in urban cities.
There are more drivers in urban cities than rural cities.
As a result, the majority of PyBer's revenue occurs in urban cities.
On the other hand, the costs for using PyBer is greater among riders in rural cities than urban cities. This could discourage potential riders from using PyBer given the high average fare per ride.
Drivers in rural cities are earning more than drivers in urban cities. This could discourage discourage potential drivers from working with PyBer given the low average fare per driver.
There is an another opportunity for further analysis to determine other factors that are contributing to the high ride costs in rural cities and low driver fares in urban cities. Perhaps, travel distance is a key factor.
Overall, PyBer ridersharing services significantly differs in rural, suruban, and urban cities given the number of rides, drivers, and fares. Data supports that there is higher usage of PyBer ridesharing services in urban cities.
